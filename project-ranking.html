<h2>My top 3 projects of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Above Ground Piping Daily Welding KPI, Sarawak Methanol Plant</h3>
<p>This is my favourite daily KPI report, which is extracting daily EPCC Oil & Gas Project Engineering Data Management System (FMCS) in cvs. The system is daily updated by 2 subcontractors from separated site office for the Above Ground Piping Daily Welding Production, which the measurement quantity is in Diameter Inches for 11 separated Modules areas. The template will be automatically extract data from the Intranet for daily welding productivity from FMCS live data and another data from the subcontractor daily submitted daily progress report for the direct manpower. The spreadsheet is for data analysis for welding productivity compared to the direct manpower deployed on each of work locations.</p>
<h3>Monthly Weather Affective Welding Productivity Report, Sarawak Methanol Plant</h3>
<p>The report will be extract the weather monitor installed on the Telecom Tower beside the project plant, it will be monitoring the daily weather 24 hours x 7 days per week. The report will tabulate non-working and working period rainfall and summarize to compare to the Above Ground Welding Productivity. The productivity trend will be observed between the raining or non-raining during the work or non-work periods.</p>
